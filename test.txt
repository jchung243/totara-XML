Technology Topic: Microservices













ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

1

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Define microservices.

QUESTION: Which TWO of the following BEST describes microservices?

ANSWERS:

Programming for nanocomputing

* An architecture and an approach to writing software

* A service that implements a single discrete function

Services tailored to small businesses

CORRECT FEEDBACK: Your answer is correct.

INCORRECT FEEDBACK: Your answer is incorrect. Review the Technology Topic: Microservices course.



2

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Identify the difference between a microservices-based approach and a traditional, monolithic approach to building applications.

QUESTION:  What is the difference between microservices versus traditional, monolithic approaches to applications?

ANSWERS:

Microservices are exclusively designed for lightweight applications

* Microservices applications consist of many microservices wired together rather than built as one single program

With Microservices, due to their distributed deployment, testing can become streamlined and easier

With a traditional, monolithic approach, applications are broken down into their smallest components

CORRECT FEEDBACK: Your answer is correct.

INCORRECT FEEDBACK: Your answer is incorrect. Review the Technology Topic: Microservices course.



3

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Identify the benefits and challenges customers could have with a microservices-based infrastructure.

QUESTION: Which TWO of the following are customer benefits of a microservices-based architecture?

ANSWERS:

* Makes applications easier to build, test, deploy, and update

Simple to refactor legacy applications into microservices

* Higher resilience since each function or service can be built and deployed independently 

The adoption of microservices always reduces complexity

CORRECT FEEDBACK: Your answer is correct.

INCORRECT FEEDBACK: Your answer is incorrect. Review the Technology Topic: Microservices course.



4

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Identify the benefits and challenges customers could have with a microservices-based infrastructure.

QUESTION: What TWO of the following are potential challenges of using microservices?

ANSWERS:
